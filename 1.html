        <h2>Profit Model and Recruitment Information</h2>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CIAdFGt.png" alt="Cosmic Image">

        <p>Boralex earns money from the electricity generated by its solar equipment. Solar energy is essential in our daily lives, used to produce electricity and heat.</p>

        <p>Currently, Boralex is hiring more part - time employees to help promote the brand. Your main job will be to promote the company's products.</p>

        <p>Not only will this help solve the problem of energy shortages in Africa, bringing convenience and environmental protection, but you can also receive a handsome salary for your promotional efforts.</p>


        <h2>Machine Rental and Earnings</h2>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QbxaeIz.jpeg" alt="Cosmic Image">

        <p>Above are the 5 different models of machines our company currently produces. You only need to rent a machine to become an official Boralex member.</p>

        <p>Once you become an official member, you can earn additional income in a variety of ways with Boralex. Renting different machines will earn you different daily income.</p>

        <p>For example, if you rent a Model B - 10 machine for 1000 ZMW, it will earn you 44 ZMW per day over a period of 50 days, for a total of 2200 ZMW <span style="color: red;">(44ZMW×50 days)</span></p>

<p style="color: #444; font-size: 0.9em;">💡 Once you rent a machine and become an official member, you’ll be able to earn income in three different ways:</p>

<p style="color: #444; font-size: 0.9em;">1️⃣ Machine income (earn daily income by renting a machine) 💰</p>
<p style="color: #444; font-size: 0.9em;">2️⃣ Promotion rewards (When others rent a machine through your promotion, you’ll earn 40 to 200 ZMW depending on the model they rent)</p>
<p style="color: #444; font-size: 0.9em;">3️⃣ Commission income (When the members you refer rent a machine, you earn not only the referral reward but also a 10% commission on their daily earnings. For example, if they earn 100 ZMW a day, you’ll earn 10 ZMW daily)</p>


        <h2>The income you earn can be withdrawn to your own MTN or Airtel account at any time</h2>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3umB9Ka.jpg" alt="Cosmic Image">
        <p>withdrawals from some members. After you rent a machine, whether it is income earned through the machine or income earned through promotion work, you can withdraw it to your own MTN or Airtel account at any time. We cooperate with MTN and Airtel to ensure that your income is stable and safe.
</p>

        <h2>How the machine generates income every day</h2>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xcygdAc.jpg" alt="Cosmic Image">

        <p>These products make money by converting solar energy into electricity. When you rent a machine, our technicians place the machine you rented in a solar base and put it into operation. The technicians manage the machine every day, so you don't have to do anything yourself. Once up and running, these machines convert solar energy into electricity every day, and that electricity is sold.</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7PK2D3m.jpg" alt="Cosmic Image">

        <p>After renting the machines, they will appear in your Boralex account. The revenue generated by these machines each day will be paid into your Boralex account. Simply take a minute each day to open your phone, log in to your Boralex account, and click the "Receive" button to collect your machines' daily revenue. It's very simple!</p>



        <h2>Win-win cooperation</h2>

        <p>If you want to join Boralex, all you need to do is rent a machine to become an official member. Once you become an official member by renting a machine, not only will you be able to enjoy the daily profits generated by the machine, but you'll also have the opportunity to work part-time promoting our products to earn more income.</p>

        <p>By renting a machine from the company, you not only benefit from the profits generated by the machine and the generous promotional rewards offered by Boralex. At the same time, Boralex's brand awareness and company value will increase thanks to the promotional efforts of its many members. It's a win-win collaboration.</p>

        <p>In the future, with the brand's influence, we will change the African market. When people think of electricity, they will think of Boralex. It's a win-win situation that will allow us to have a stable and lasting cooperation with Boralex.</p>

        <p>When someone rents a machine through your referral, you immediately receive a referral bonus. Some people earn up to 2,000 ZMW per day thanks to Boralex.
