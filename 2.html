        <p>This is Amanda's third day at Boralex. In just three days, she's already earned over 1500 ZMW and successfully withdrawn her bonus. Successful people are always in the minority. Because only those who seize opportunities and move towards their goals can fulfill their dreams. Being satisfied with the status quo will lead to stagnation, and continuous learning is the key to progress.üí™</p>

        <p>Everyone has their own "pressures". Whether as a father or in any other role, we all have our own responsibilities to bear. Only by constantly improving ourselves and becoming better can we have the confidence to face some possible unknown difficulties in the future. Mr. Mukuka joined Boralex because of family pressure. Now he can earn 500 ZMW every day through Boralex, which is enough for him to face some of the responsibilities he has to bear with ease.</p>

        <p>Maureen was a supermarket attendant before joining Boralex. Now, after joining Boralex, she can earn around 600 ZMW every day. She shared with me photos of her having a get - together dinner with her family. The significance of hard work became tangible at this moment. I've always believed that "the you in the future depends on the you right now." Being generous to the future means devoting everything to the present.</p>

        <p>Cartel joined about a month ago. With the money he earned through hard work at Boralex, he bought himself a mobile phone worth around 32,000 ZMW as a reward for his efforts. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Only by starting can there be change. Even a magnificent building is made up of seemingly insignificant bricks and stones, one by one. After you join Boralex, I'll patiently guide and help you.</p>

        <p>Mwansa took out the money he earned this month because his father's business needed some funds, so he planned to give the money to his father. He worked at Boralex for about an hour every day. He told me that he would take this job more seriously and believed that his income would continue to increase in the future. The only obstacle to achieving tomorrow's ideal is today's hesitation. Take the first step bravely, and the wonderful future will unfold slowly before your eyes. </p>
